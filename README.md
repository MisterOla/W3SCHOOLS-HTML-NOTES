* #HTML Introduction


HTML describe webpage structure with tags marking the documents appropriately to 
tell the browser what each tagged element is. 

Here, <!DOCTYPE html> defines that document is html5, <html> is root element of an html page, 
<head> contains meta information about the html page, <title> specifies title  for the page( which is shown in the browser's title bar or page's tab. <body> is a container for all visible contents of a site. 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


<br> is an empty element...elements without content

*browsers use tag to determine how to display the content of a 


*UTF-8 is preferred way to encode html file and save type as "All Files(*.*)"



.htm or .html extensions are the same thing. You decide whichever one you want.

-------------------------------------------
HTML BASICS

*<!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers display web pages correctly. Must appear once in the webpage, not case sensitive

* This is how to declare doctype for HTML5
<!DOCTYPE html>  

*Attributes provide additional information about html elements
<a> defines html links

'href' attribute defines link destination


<img> defines html images. The attributes src(source file), alternative text(alt), width,and height



When you inspect a site, you can edit the html or css on-the-fly. 


Example of using the imag tag

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>HTML Images</h2>
<p>HTML images are defined with the img tag:</p>

<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

</body>
</html>


-----------------------------------------------------------
HTML ELEMENTS

*HTML element is everything from start to end of tag
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname> 

*The  <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole html document.

**Even though skipping the end tag can work, skipping the end tag is not reliable

Never rely on the fact that some tags could run without end tag. Unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag.


*empty elements have no content. 
<br> defines line break and it is an empty element without a closing tag.


HTML is not case sensitive but xhtml is more strict. So always use lower case letter do denote tags

----------------------------
HTML ATTRIBUTES
 **Attribute comes as name="value"

*HTML links: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a> 


The SRC attribute: 
<h2>The src Attribute</h2>
<p>HTML images are defined with the img tag, and the filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute:</p>

<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

**specifying the url int eh src attribute


Absolute url: links to image on another site: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg"

Relative url: Links to image hosted within the website. No domain name included here. src="img_girl.jpg"
src="/images/img_girl.jpg"   **in this case, the slash is relative to the site url

**Width and height attribute(pixels) with <img>
 <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600"> 


**Alt attribute includes alternative text for the image incase a user can not read the image: <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket"> 


**style attribute adds style elements like color, font, size, etc to an image

 <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p> 


**Lang attribute: Should always be included inside an <html> tag the declare website language to assist search engines locate you


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>


*You can also include country attribute.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>



**The title attribute: Gives extra information about an element and the attribute
will be displayed as a tooltip when mouse pointer runs over it.
  
 <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p> 

W3C Recommends having attributes in quote and in cases where there is a space in the attribute, you have to have the space.

*when  attribute value contains one of the quotes, use the other quote

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>

Or vice versa:
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson"> 


***Attributes Summary

    All HTML elements can have attributes
    The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
    The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
    The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
    The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
    The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font,       size, and more
    The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element





HTML HEADINGS

Headings go from <h1> to <h6>. Search engines use them to understand the structure of the webpage

Use h1 for main headings followed by h2 and so on

Each heading has its default size. You can change that by specifying inside a style element.

*Change your style like this:

<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>



PARAGRAPHS

In html, you cannot be sure of how html will be displayed on each screen size. Adding extra lines or spaces to the document does not add new lines to the page. 
Browser removes extra spaces once page displays


<p>This is a paragraph</p>

*horizontal rules: <hr> Used to separate content(define change) and defines a thematic break in an HTML page. It shows up as an horizontal line. 
<hr> tag has no closing tag since it is an empty tag.


*Line breaks: <br> element
Use this when you want a line break without starting a new paragraph.


The Poem Problem: Poems have to be included in the <pre> preformatted text tag
The <pre> tag displays text in fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.

Tags summary
<p> 	Defines a paragraph
<hr> 	Defines a thematic change in the content
<br> 	Inserts a single line break
<pre> 	Defines pre-formatted text


 
HTML STYLES
The HTML Style attribute syntax:

<tagname style="property:value;">
*where The property is a CSS property and value is a CSS value.


*Background color: Defines the background color for an HTML element
<body style="background-color:powderblue;">

*Set background color for two different elements:
<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="background-color:tomato;">This is a paragraph.</p>

**Text color
 <h1 style="color:blue;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p> 

**Fonts
 <h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p> 

**Text Size
 <h1 style="font-size:300%;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-size:160%;">This is a paragraph.</p> 

**Text alignment
 <h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p> 


Styles summary


    Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
    Use background-color for background color
    Use color for text colors
    Use font-family for text fonts
    Use font-size for text sizes
    Use text-align for text alignment


HTML FORMATTING

    <b> - Bold text
    <strong> - Important text
    <i> - Italic text...often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.
    <em> - Emphasized text. A screen reader will emphasize the text using verbal stress
    <mark> - Marked text. Element that should be highlighted. You can use style to change the color.
    <small> - Smaller text
    <del> - Deleted text. Browsers usually strike a line through
    <ins> - Inserted text... (into a document) Browsers usually underline this. Can be used after del. 
    <sub> - Subscript text...appears half a character below the normal line
    <sup> - Superscript text...can be used for footnotes citation

*<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>



HTML QUOTATION AND CITATION ELEMENTS

<abbr> 	Defines an abbreviation or acronym. Marking them give information to browsers, translation systems and search engines. Use global attribute title with it to show full meaning of the abbreviation.
<address> 	Defines contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article. This can be email, url, physical, mobile no, social media handles etc. Browsers add line break before and after <address> element.
<bdo> 	Defines the text direction.Used to override current text direction
<blockquote> 	Defines a section that is quoted from another source. Browser usually indents this. cite is used here to show the source, not href.
<cite> 	Defines the title of a creative work. Creator's name is not a title.Browsers will usually cite this element in italic
<q> 	Defines a short inline quotation.Browser inserts quotation marks around the quotation

HTML COLORS

You specify them with color names, RGB, HEX, HSL,RGBA(the alpha is for transparency),HSLA values.

HTML supports 140 standard color names

**Specify background color as shown below:
 <h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;">Lorem ipsum...</p> 


**set color of text
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Lorem ipsum...</p>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Ut wisi enim...</p> 


**Set Color of border ( the square box) around text

 <h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;">Hello World</h1> 

**These are all the same
rgb(255, 99, 71)
#ff6347
hsl(9, 100%, 64%)



**RGBA, HSLA

rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5)

** <h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">...</h1>

<h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">...</h1> 


RGB and RGBA Coloring

Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha

rgb(r,g,b)  each parameter has a value between  0 and 255 i.e 256 in total


Total number of colors: 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!

Red color: rgb(255, 0, 0), 
Green color: rgb(0, 255, 0)
Black: rgb(0, 0, 0)
White:rgb(255, 255, 255). 
Grey: rgb( x,x,x) where x is not zero or 255. Black and white are at the two ends of the color spectrum.


RGBA

rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) alpha 0 means fully transparent while 1.0 is not transparent at all. 


HTML HEX COLORS

RR(RED), GG(GREEN)BB(BLUE)...HEXADECIMAL INTEGERS SPECIFY THE COMPONENTS OF THE COLORS, EACH WITH VALUES RANGING FROM 00 TO ff ( same as decimal 0-255)

#ff0000- red since red has the highest value (ff) while the green and blue appear as 00 and 00

#00ff00 appears as green since green is set to the highest value(ff) and the remaining two have zero values

To display black, set all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000.
To display white, setll all color parameters to ff: #ffffff

Shades of gray: Equal values for all the parameters:
*each one of these are different shades of gray.
#404040
#686868
#a0a0a0


HSL: Hue, Saturation, and, lightness

HSLA: Hue, Saturation, Lightness, and Alpha.

Hue: Degree on the colorwheel from 0 to 360  0 is red, 120 gree, 240 blue

Saturation: It is a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100 % is full color 

Lightness:Alsp a percentage value: 0% is black and 100% white



Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color. It is about how much shade of gray you want to have showing up on the color. 

100% is pure color, no shades of gray

50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.

0% is completely gray, you can no longer see the color.


**The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light) 100% means full lightness (white).


Shades of Gray: Can be obtained by setting hue and saturation to 0, and adjust the lighness from 0 % to 100 % to get darker/lighter shades: 

hsl(0, 0%, 20%)   --darker shade of grey
hsl(0, 0%, 70%)== lighter shade of grey


HSLA Color Values: 

Alpha rep transparency. 0.00 means fully transparent and 1.0 not transparent at all. 



HTML STYLES-CSS (HTML CSS)

CSS can control layout of multiple pages at same time. 

CSS: CAscading style sheets: To control color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes etc



Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!


CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

    Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
    Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
    External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file


Inline CSS: To apply a unique style to a single HTML element, and it uses the style attribute of such element. 

* Set h1 color to blue and p to red

 <h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>

<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p> 


Internal CSS: To define style for a single HTML Page and it defined in <head> section of an html page within <style> element


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html> 


External CSS: Define style for many HTML pages. To use the external style, you add a link to it in the head section of the html. File must not contain any HTML Code and can be written in any text editor. Save with a .css extension. 


 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html> 



**Styles.css looks like this
body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}




CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes

Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will learn more about them later.

The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.

The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.

The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.


**Use of CSS color, font-family, and font-size properties.

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 300%;
}
p {
  color: red;
  font-family: courier;
  font-size: 160%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html> 



**CSS Border

The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element.

Tip: You can define a border for nearly all HTML elements.


Use of CSS border property: 
p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
}


**CSS Padding

The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.

Use of CSS border and padding properties:
p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  padding: 30px;
} 


**CSS Margin

The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  margin: 50px;
}


**Link to External CSS

External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.

*Example, linking to a full style sheet
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/styles.css"> 

*links to a style sheet located in the html folder on the current web site: 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/html/styles.css"> 

HTML CSS SUMMARY: 
    Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling
    Use the HTML <style> element to define internal CSS
    Use the HTML <link> element to refer to an external CSS file
    Use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements
    Use the CSS color property for text colors
    Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
    Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
    Use the CSS border property for borders
    Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
    Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border




HTML LINKS 

They are hyperlinks that can be clicked to be redirected to another page.
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!


<a> tag defines hyperlinks: 

<a href="url">link text</a>

href attribute is the link destination, and the link text is what the use sees.

 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a> 


**By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

    An unvisited link is underlined and blue
    A visited link is underlined and purple
    An active link is underlined and red

You can also style a link with CSS


**HTML Links - The target Attribute

By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.


Possible Values for the target attribute: 


    _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
    _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
    _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
    _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window



**Absolute vs Relative URLs
Absolute URLs use the full web address in href attribute. 

A link to a page within the current is specified with a relative URL( OMITTING HTTPS://WWW.)

*Examples of relative and absolute URL:
 <h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

<h2>Relative URLs</h2>
<p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></p>
<p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p> 


**HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link: To do this, just use in image <img> tae

 <a href="default.asp">
<img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a> 


**Link to an Email Address: use mailto: inside href attribute to create a link that oopens in the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

** <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a> 


**To use a button as an HTML Link; you need to add some Js CODES. JS allows you to specify what happends at cetain events, such as a click of a button:

**Here is the JS code
 <button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button> 

** LInk titles: Shown as tooltip when mouse pointer is moved on element.

 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a> 


**More on relative and absolute URLS:

*Use a full URL to link to a web page: 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a> 

*Link to a page located in the html folder on the current web site: 
<a href="/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a> 

*Link to a page located in the same folder ( within the html folder of the current website ) as the current page: 
<a href="default.asp">HTML tutorial</a> 



    Use the <a> element to define a link
    Use the href attribute to define the link address
    Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
    Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
    Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a> 


cHAPTER SUMMARY:

    Use the <a> element to define a link
    Use the href attribute to define the link address
    Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
    Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
    Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program


HTML Links - Different Colors

By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):

    An unvisited link is underlined and blue
    A visited link is underlined and purple
    An active link is underlined and red

**The default css for links is :

<style>
a:link {
  color: green;

<style>
a:link, a:visited {
  background-color: #f44336;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 25px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
}

a:hover, a:active {
  background-color: red;
}
</style> 




**HTML Links - Create Bookmarks: can enable users to jump to certain part of a webpage. This helps for a long webpage. 

*To create bookmark, create bookmark then add link to it. Clicking the page automatically redirects to boookmarked location in the webpage

-Use id attribute to create a bookmark: 

<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>

-Add link to the bookmark from within the same page.
 <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a> 

-Add link to a bookmark on another page: 

<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

**To remove the underline from link, remove text decoration: 

<a href="html_images.asp" style="text-decoration:none">HTML Images</a> 

Chapter Summary:
Chapter Summary

Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark



HTML5 IMAGES

<img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">


Image tag is used to insert images in a webpage. Images are linked to a webpage not embeded. 

SRC attributes
    src - Specifies the path to the image
    alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

Syntax
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext"> 

Browsers get image from a web server and inserts into the page each time yu load. Image stays in same spot in relation to a webpage...else the alt text shows up to indicate that the link is brocken.

**Value of alt attribute shows in cases where: because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader which reads html code and reads out for the user...usually used by the visually impaired people.


**You can also specify width and height in the style attribute of the image

 <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;"> 

**With and height attribute as width and height attribute...which is always in pixels
 <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600"> 

**It is better to use style attribute so the stylesheet does not end up changing image size.


 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
img {
  width: 100%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="128" height="128">

<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">

</body>
</html> 


**For images in the subfolder, you must include the folder name

**Animated Images:: HTML allows GIFs

 <img src="programming.gif" alt="Computer Man" style="width:48px;height:48px;"> 

**Image as a tag:: Put <img> tag inside the <a> tag

 <a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a> 

**Let image float to the right or to the left of a text using CSS float property
 <p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">
The image will float to the right of the text.</p>

<p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:left;width:42px;height:42px;">
The image will float to the left of the text.</p> 


**Common image formats supported on a website

bbreviation 	File Format 	File Extension
APNG 	Animated Portable Network Graphics 	.apng
GIF 	Graphics Interchange Format 	.gif
ICO 	Microsoft Icon 	.ico, .cur
JPEG 	Joint Photographic Expert Group image 	.jpg, .jpeg, .jfif, .pjpeg, .pjp
PNG 	Portable Network Graphics 	.png
SVG 	Scalable Vector Graphics 	.svg


**Loading large images takes time and can slow down your webpage...so use images carefully.

Image Maps::Allows you to perform actions depending on where in image  you click. You need an image, some html code that describes the clickable area. 

The image: Inserted using image tag, but you must add usemap attribute in this case.


<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">


-The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.

You can use any image as an image map.

-add a <map> element linked to the image using the name attribute.


<map name="workmap">

name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute

-Add clickable area to the image: You define the clickable area using an <area> element.
*define shape of the clickable area using any of these values: 
    rect - defines a rectangular region
    circle - defines a circular region
    poly - defines a polygonal region
    default - defines the entire region

-Define coordinate to be able to place the clickable area onto the image.


Shape="rect"

The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis (distance from left) and one for the y-axis(distance from top).

So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top:

The coordinates 270,350 is located 270 pixels from the left margin and 350 pixels from the top:


Shape="circle"

To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle:

337,300  

then specify the radius: 44 pixels


** <area shape="circle" coords="337, 300, 44" href="coffee.htm"> 

Shape=poly"

The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).

This can be used to create any shape. Such as a croissant. You have to find x and y coordinates for all edges of the croissant.

*Each point has x and y...specify all the coordinates around the perimeter of the polygonal shape. 

 <area shape="poly" coords="140,121,181,116,204,160,204,222,191,270,140,329,85,355,58,352,37,322,40,259,103,161,128,147" href="croissant.htm"> 


**You can also trigger a JS function by clicking the poissant shape.
Add a click event to the <area> element to execute a JavaScript function:

 <map name="workmap">
  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" onclick="myFunction()">
</map>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  alert("You clicked the coffee cup!");
}
</script> 



You can use href with the function to inform user to confirm what they are trying to do before they follow the hyperlink on the picture.



**Image Map summary: =


<img> 	Defines an image
<map> 	Defines an image map
<area> 	Defines a clickable area inside an image map
<picture> 	Defines a container for multiple image resources



**Background Images: Repeats itself if it is smaller 

*Add background image on an HTML element using style attribute and css background-image.

 <div style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');"> 


**You can also specify background image in the style element of the head section

 <style>
div {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style> 



**Adding background image for an entire page:specify background image on the body element

 <style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style> 




**Background image repeat:: Background image smaller than the element will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically,until it reaches the end of the element. 


 <style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style> 

**You can set background repeat property to no repeat to prevent the background image from repeating itself. 

 <style>
body {
  background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
</style> 



*Background Cover: You can set background-size property to cover to make background image to cover the entire element. set the background-attachment property to fixed to make sure the entire element is always covered...This keeps image original proportions. 


<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: cover;



**Background stretch::  Allows you to make the background image to stretch to fit the entire element. Set background-size property to 100% 100%


 <style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: 100% 100%;
}
</style> 




HTML PICTURE ELEMENT::


<picture> element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen sizes. 


 <picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
  <img src="img_girl.jpg">
</picture> 


*<img> element should be specified last in the picture element. This element is used by the browsers that do not support the picture elment or if none of the  <source> tags work.

When to use the picture element:: 
-Bandwidth:: Wnen on a small screen device, browser searches through the source elements to find the matching element first. 

-Format Support:: You can also add all image formats so that different browser image supports can be accommodated. In this case, the device use the first image format that it supports and ignore the rest. 


 <picture>
  <source srcset="img_avatar.png">
  <source srcset="img_girl.jpg">
  <img src="img_beatles.gif" alt="Beatles" style="width:auto;">
</picture> 

HTML IMAGE TAGS SUMMARIZED:::

<area> 	Defines a clickable area inside an image map
<picture> 	Defines a container for multiple image resources



HTML TABLES

<table> tag defined the HTML table. 
<tr> defines table row
<th> defines table header. By default bold and centered.
<td> defines table data/cell.. By default regular and left-aligned. They are data containers for text, images, lists, other tables, etc.




* A Simple HTML Table

 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

**Table looks like this::
Firstname 	Lastname 	Age
Jill 	Smith 	50
Eve 	Jackson 	94
John 	Doe 	80


*Add a border to HTML table:::

table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}


**Collapsed Table Border:: Add Border collapse property to enable all borders to collapse into  one border. 

table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}


**Add Cell Padding::: Specifies the space between the cell and its borders. If not specified, table cells are displayed without padding. Use css padding property to set padding:

th, td {
  padding: 15px;
}





**Left-align Headings::Table headings are by default bold and centred. 

To left-align table headings, use CSS text-align property. 

th {
  text-align: left;
}


**Add border spacing:: Specifies space between cells. Use CSS border-spacing property. Border spacing has no effect for table with collapsed borders

table {
  border-spacing: 5px;
}



**Cells that Spans Many Columns:: use colspan attribute

 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th colspan="2">Telephone</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bill Gates</td>
    <td>55577854</td>
    <td>55577855</td>
  </tr>
</table> 


**Looks like this:Name 	Telephone
Bill Gates 	55577854 	55577855


**Make cell that spans many rows::use rowspan. rowspan=2 means that you will specify two row <tr> elements to contain the content spanning two rows


 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Name:</th>
    <td>Bill Gates</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Telephone:</th>
    <td>55577854</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>55577855</td>
  </tr>
</table> 



**Add a caption to the table:: use <caption>  tag...inserted immediately after the table tag

 <table style="width:100%">
  <caption>Monthly savings</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Month</th>
    <th>Savings</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>January</td>
    <td>$100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>February</td>
    <td>$50</td>
  </tr>
</table> 



**Define a special style for one table. Add an id to the table and then define the special style next
 
<table id="t01">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table> 


#t01 {
  width: 100%;
  background-color: #f1f1c1;
}



you can also add more styles:

#t01 tr:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: #eee;
}
#t01 tr:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #fff;
}
#t01 th {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}

HTML BLOCK AND INLINE ELEMENTS

Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. Display values can be block or inline
 
*Block-level Elements
Block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can)

<div> element is a block-level element

Other block-level element include:
Here are the block-level elements in HTML:
<address>
<article>
<aside>
<blockquote>
<canvas>
<dd>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>
<fieldset>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>

<hr>
<li>
<main>
<nav>
<noscript>
<ol>
<p>
<pre>
<section>
<table>
<tfoot>
<ul>
<video>


**Inline Elements:
It does not start on a new line but only takes as much width as necessary. 
example: This is a <span> elements inside a paragraph.

 <span>Hello World</span> 

*The list of inline elements:

Here are the inline elements in HTML:
<a>
<abbr>
<acronym>
<b>
<bdo>
<big>
<br>
<button>
<cite>
<code>

<q>
<samp>
<script>
<select>
<small>
<span>
<strong>
<sub>
<sup>
<textarea>
<time>
<tt>
<var>

* An inline element cannot contain a block-level element


The <div> Element

<div> element is used as a container for other HTML elements.

<div> element has no required attribute. the common attributes of the div element are: style, class, id

When used together with CSS, the <div> element can used to style blocks of content: 

 <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div> 


The <span> Element: Used to mark up a part of a text, or part of a document. <span> element has no required attribute...style,class and id are common ones. When used with css, the span element can be used to style parts of a text.

*<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>

**Chapter Summary

    There are two display values: block and inline
    A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
    An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
    The <div> element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
    The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document


**HTML Tags summarized
Tag 	Description
<div> 	Defines a section in a document (block-level)
<span> 	Defines a section in a document (inline)



HTML CLASSES

**html class attribute is used to specify a class for an html element. 

*Multiple html elements can also share the same class.
*Class attribute is used to point to a class to manipulate together in a style sheet. Javascript can also manipulate elements in the same class together.


**In the example below, all three div elements with class city are style equally together equally according to the .city style definition in the header.

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="city">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Paris</h2>
  <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Tokyo</h2>
  <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html> 




**Here we can also style note class in <span> elements with .note style definition

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.note {
  font-size: 120%;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My <span class="note">Important</span> Heading</h1>
<p>This is some <span class="note">important</span> text.</p>

</body>
</html> 



NB

Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.

Note: The class name is case sensitive!


*The Syntax for Class. 

To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p>London is the capital of England.</p>

<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>

</body>
</html>



*Multiple classes. 

HTML elements can belong to multiple classes. Define multiple classes by separating the class names with a space. The element will be styled according to all classes specified. 

Below, <h2> elements belongs to both city class and also main class(<div class="city main">)

Below, h2 element belongs to both city class and also to the main class and will get CSS styles from both of the classes

<h2 class="city main">London</h2>
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>

* The full html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
} 

.main {
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Multiple Classes</h2>
<p>Here, all three h2 elements belongs to the "city" class. In addition, London also belongs to the "main" class, which center-aligns the text.</p>

<h2 class="city main">London</h2>
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>

</body>
</html>


**Different HTML elements like<p> and <h2> points to city class ans share same style

<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p class="city">Paris is the capital of France</p>


**Use ofthe class Attribute in Javascript
Class name can also be used by JS to perform certain tasks for specific elements. 
JS usually access elemetns with a specific class name with the getElementByClassName() method:


 <script>
function myFunction() {
  var x = document.getElementsByClassName("city");
  for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
    x[i].style.display = "none";
  }
}
</script> 









HTML ID ATTRIBUTE: Used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

Only one element has a particular id. 


The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. Also used by JS to access and manipulate elements with the specific id. 

id syntax: write hash (#) followed by an id name. Then define the CSS properties with curly braces {}. in the sheet below, <h1> element is styled according to the #myHeader style definition in the header section


 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

</body>
</html> 


**The id name is case sensitive! And it must contain at least one character, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.).

Diff between Class and ID: Class can be used by multiple HTML elements while id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page. 

**Below we illlustrate the difference between Class and ID

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
/* Style the element with the id "myHeader" */
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Style all elements with the class name "city" */
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
} 
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Difference Between Class and ID</h2>
<p>A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:</p>

<!-- An element with a unique id -->
<h1 id="myHeader">My Cities</h1>

<!-- Multiple elements with same class -->
<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p>London is the capital of England.</p>

<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>

</body>
</html>


**HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links. 

Html bookmarks allows readers to jump to a specific part of a webpage, useful for very long pages. 

To use a bookmark, create it and then add a link to it. Once link is clicked, page scrolls to the location with the bookmark.


**To create a bookmark, 

<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>


*To add a link to it:

 <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a> 

*To add a link to the bookmark (Jump to Chapter 4) from another page.


<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>



**See the demonstration below:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p><a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a></p>
<p><a href="#C10">Jump to Chapter 10</a></p>

*Using the id Attribute in JavaScript

The id attribute can also be used by JavaScript to perform some tasks for that specific element.

JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method:


 <script>
function displayResult() {
  document.getElementById("myHeader").innerHTML = "Have a nice day!";
}
</script> 


*Chapter Summary::
Chapter Summary

    The id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element
    The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document
    The id attribute is used by CSS and JavaScript to style/select a specific element
    The value of the id attribute is case sensitive
    The id attribute is also used to create HTML bookmarks
    JavaScript can access an element with a specific id with the getElementById() method



HTML iframes 

It is used to display a webpage within another webpage

*HTML Iframe syntax



HTML Iframe Syntax:

<iframe> tag specifies an inline frame. This inline frame is used to  embed another document within the current html document

**Syntax example below

<iframe src="url" title="description">

NB: It is a good practice to always include a title attribute for the <iframe>. This is used by screen readers to read out what the content of the iframe is.


**Use height and width to specify the size ofthe iframe

<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" height="200" width="300" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>


**You can also add style attribute and use css height and width properties:

<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="height:200px;width:300px;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>


**Iframe-Remove the border

*To remove border add style attribute and use the CSS border property. 

<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="border:none;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>


*You can also use css style to change the size and color of the iframe's border:


<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="border:2px solid red;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>


Iframe - Target for a Link

An iframe can be used as the target frame for a link. The target attribute of the link must refer to the name attribute ofthe iframe

<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" name="iframe_a" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="iframe_a">W3Schools.com</a></p>


**When the target attribute of a link matches the name of an iframe, the link will open in the iframe


In essence, the target of a url can be a new (_blank) page and  can also be the name (attribute) of an iframe




HTML JavaScript



Javascript inclusion in HTML makes it more interactive and dynamic.


**The below gives a button that shows date and time. 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First JavaScript</h1>

<button type="button"
onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
Click me to display Date and Time.</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

</body>
</html> 


*HTML Script tag.

It defines client-side JavaScript...the the <script> element contains script statement or points to an external script through an src attribute. JS is used for image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.

To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method.

This JavaScript example writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":

<h2>Use JavaScript to Change Text</h2>
<p>This example writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
</script> 


**Use JavaScript to change the style of an HTML document
<h1>My First JavaScript</h1>

<p id="demo">JavaScript can change the style of an HTML element.</p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "25px"; 
  document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "red";
  document.getElementById("demo").style.backgroundColor = "yellow";        
}
</script>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>



***Use Javascript to change the src attribute of an image.
document.getElementById("image").src = "picture.gif";

*see full code below

<h1>My First JavaScript</h1>
<p>Here, a JavaScript changes the value of the src (source) attribute of an image.</p>

<script>
function light(sw) {
  var pic;
  if (sw == 0) {
    pic = "pic_bulboff.gif"
  } else {
    pic = "pic_bulbon.gif"
  }
  document.getElementById('myImage').src = pic;
}
</script>

<img id="myImage" src="pic_bulboff.gif" width="100" height="180">

<p>
<button type="button" onclick="light(1)">Light On</button>
<button type="button" onclick="light(0)">Light Off</button>
</p>


*HTML <noscript> tag

Defines alternate content to be displayed to users that have disabled scripts in their browsers or have browsers with no support for scripts

*This is the script 
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
</script>
<noscript>Sorry, your browser does not support JavaScript!</noscript> 

**The full script is:
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
</script>

<noscript>Sorry, your browser does not support JavaScript!</noscript>

<p>A browser without support for JavaScript will show the text written inside the noscript element.</p>





HTML FILE PATHS

A file path describes the location of a file in a website's folder structure. 

Examples of filepath

Path	Description
<img src="picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the same folder as the current page
<img src="images/picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder
<img src="/images/picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web
<img src="../picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder



Path	Description
<img src="picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the same folder as the current page
<img src="images/picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder
<img src="/images/picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web
<img src="../picture.jpg"> 	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder


*A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.

File paths are used when linking to external files, like:

    Web pages
    Images
    Style sheets
    JavaScripts



Absolute file paths: the full url to a file

 <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"> 


Relative file paths: Points to a file relative to the current page. 

*File path pointing to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web. 

 <img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"> 


*File path pointing to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:

 <img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"> 


*File paths pointing to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level up from the current folder:

 <img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"> 

Advice:

Best Practice

It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).

When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future public domains.



*HTML HEAD- The Head Element


<head> element contains the <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, <base> elements. 

<head> element
The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.

HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.






<title> element:

Defines document title, it must contain only text and it is shown in the browser title bar or in page's tag. Title element is required in html documents. The content ofthis page title helps for Search Engine Optimization of a webpage which is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

    defines a title in the browser toolbar
    provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
    displays a title for the page in search engine-results

So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible


The HTML <style> element

This element is used to define style information for a single HTML page. 

 <style>
  body {background-color: powderblue;}
  h1 {color: red;}
  p {color: blue;}
</style> 


The HTML <link> Element.

Defines relationship between current document and an external resource. Link tag is most used to link to external style sheets:

 <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"> 


**The link element in action
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>


The HTML <meta> Element

Typically used to specify the character set, page description, kyewords, author of document, and viewport settings. 

The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but are used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.


**Examples

Examples

Define the character set used:
<meta charset="UTF-8">

Define keywords for search engines:
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">

Define a description of your web page:
<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">

Define the author of a page:
<meta name="author" content="John Doe">

Refresh document every 30 seconds:
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">





Example of <meta> tags: 

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
<meta name="author" content="John Doe">


*Setting The Viewport
Viewport if user's visible area of a webpage. Varies with the device and is smaller on a mobile phone than PC screen. 


You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">



This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.


*HTML <script> Element.

The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScript. 

*The script below writes "Hello JavaScript" into an HTML element with id="demo"

 <script>
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
}
</script> 



The HTML <base> Element

<base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page. 

The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both.

There can only be one single <base> element in a document!


**Specify a default URL and a default target for all links on a page:

<head>
<base href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">
</head>

<body>
<img src="images/stickman.gif" width="24" height="39" alt="Stickman">
<a href="tags/tag_base.asp">HTML base Tag</a>
</body>

HTML LAYOUT--Layout Elements and Techniques

HTML has semantic elements 

    <header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
    <nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
    <section> - Defines a section in a document
    <article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
    <aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
    <footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
    <details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
    <summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element


Techniques for creating HTML layouts
    CSS framework
    CSS float property
    CSS flexbox
    CSS grid

*CSS Frameworks: Enable you to fastly create your layout: W3.CSS and Boostrap are examples

CSS Float layout: Use CSS float property to do web layout. You just need to remember float and clear properties to use this. Its main disadvantage is the it is tied to the document flow which may harm flexibility.

CSS Flexbox layout::Ensures that elements behave predictably when  multiple sizes of user screen must display site well. 


CSS Gridlayout: Offers grid-based layout system which facilitate designing webpages without floats and positioning and using rows and columns to achieve this.

------

HTML RESPONSIVE--Responsive Web Design;

Responsive web looks good irrespecive of the device and it automatically adjust for different sizes and viewports.

Here, HTML and CSS automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge a site to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones)

To create a responsive site, add the following <meta> tag to all your web pages:

 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 

*Responsive Images: Scale nicely to fit any browser size. To make image responsive set CSS width property to 100 % and image will become responsive according to the needs. 
See code below for a responsive image. 

 <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:100%;"> 

To avoid image scaling up beyond original size, use max-width property instead of the width:100%. For exaMple:

 <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"> 


**To show different images depending on browser width, use <picture> element.

 <picture>
  <source srcset="img_smallflower.jpg" media="(max-width: 600px)">
  <source srcset="img_flowers.jpg" media="(max-width: 1500px)">
  <source srcset="flowers.jpg">
  <img src="img_smallflower.jpg" alt="Flowers">
</picture> 


**Responsive Text Size.

The text size can be set with "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width"  to enable text size to follow the size ofthe browser window

*the code below enables responsive text size

 <h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1> 

*Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.


*Media queries: Enables you to define completely different styles for different browser sizes. 


 <style>
.left, .right {
  float: left;
  width: 20%; /* The width is 20%, by default */
}

.main {
  float: left;
  width: 60%; /* The width is 60%, by default */
}

/* Use a media query to add a breakpoint at 800px: */
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
  .left, .main, .right {
    width: 100%; /* The width is 100%, when the viewport is 800px or smaller */
  }
}
</style> 




*W3.CSS

W3.CSS is a modern CSS framework with support for desktop, tablet, and mobile design by default.

W3.CSS is smaller and faster than similar CSS frameworks.

W3.CSS is designed to be a high quality alternative to Bootstrap.

W3.CSS is designed to be independent of jQuery or any other JavaScript library.


**Example of a full responsive web
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
<body>

<div class="w3-container w3-green">
  <h1>W3Schools Demo</h1>
  <p>Resize this responsive page!</p>
</div>

<div class="w3-row-padding">
  <div class="w3-third">
    <h2>London</h2>
    <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
    <p>It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom,
    with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-third">
    <h2>Paris</h2>
    <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
    <p>The Paris area is one of the largest population centers in Europe,
    with more than 12 million inhabitants.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-third">
    <h2>Tokyo</h2>
    <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
    <p>It is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area,
    and the most populous metropolitan area in the world.</p>
  </div>
</div>

</body>
</html> 



**Bootstrap: another framework that uses HTML, CSS, and JQuery to make web pages:

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>Bootstrap Example</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<div class="container">
  <div class="jumbotron">
    <h1>My First Bootstrap Page</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      ...
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      ...

HTML Computer Code Elements

These are the different html elements for defining use input and computer code.

*Code element
 <code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code> 


*HTML <kbd> For Keyboard Input

<kbd> element defines keyboard input... and the content inside this tag is displayed inside the browser's default monospace font.

* <p>Save the document by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd></p> 

The code above shows:Save the document by pressing Ctrl + S


HTML <samp> For Program Output
Samp element can be used to define sample output from a computer program. The content is displayed inside browser's default monospace font. 

*To define some text as sample output from a computer program:

 <p>Message from my computer:</p>
<p><samp>File not found.<br>Press F1 to continue</samp></p> 



HTML <code> For Computer Code.

This element defines a piece of computer code. Content is displayed inside the browser's default monospace font. 

<h2>The code Element</h2>
<p>Programming code example:</p>

<code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>


*To preserve the extra white spaces in a <code> element, use a <pre> element to enclose the <code> element.

 <pre>
<code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>
</pre> 


HTML <var> For Variables
It is used to define variable in programming or in a mathematical expression. The content inside is typically displayed in italics. 

 <p>The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x <var>b</var> x <var>h</var>, where <var>b</var> is the base, and <var>h</var> is the vertical height.</p> 

The result is:
The area of a triangle is: 1/2 x b x h, where b is the base, and h is the vertical height.


*Chapter Summary

    The <kbd> element defines keyboard input
    The <samp> element defines sample output from a computer program
    The <code> element defines a piece of computer code
    The <var> element defines a variable in programming or in a mathematical expression
    The <pre> element defines preformatted text

-----
HTML semantic Elements

Semantic elements are the elements that have a meaning and this meaning describes the content to both browser and the developer. 

Non-semantic element: <div> and <span>   tells nothing about the content

Semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article>  defines content
Sites usually define elements:<div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

*Semantic Elements in HTML
    <article>
    <aside>
    <details>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <header>
    <main>
    <mark>
    <nav>
    <section>
    <summary>
    <time>


HTML <section> Element:  A Thematic grouping of content typically with a heading. You can split a webpage into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.

 <section>
<h1>WWF</h1>

Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa.

The <article> element specifies independent self-contained content while <section> eleemnt defines a section in a document.

You will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> element and <article> elements containing <section>


HTML <header> Element

</footer> 


HTML <nav> Element:Defines a set of navigation links.

<nav> element define a set of navigation links which are the major  blocks of navigation links. So you should not use <nav>for all links.

Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.

**A set of navigation links

 <nav>
  <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
  <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
  <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
  <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
</nav> 



HTML <aside> Element
Defines some contents aside from the content it is placed in like sidebar. The <aside> contentshould be indirectly related to the surrounding content.

<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p>

<aside>
<h4>Epcot Center</h4>
<p>Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.</p>
</aside>


*Using CSS to style the aside element.

<html>
<head>
<style>
aside {
  width: 30%;
  padding-left: 15px;
  margin-left: 15px;
  float: right;
  font-style: italic;
  background-color: lightgray;

HTML <figure> and <figcaption> Elements

The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element. The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a <figure> element.

The <img> element defines the actual image/illustration. 

* Sample code for figure and figure caption

<figure>
  <img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
  <figcaption>Fig1. - Trulli, Puglia, Italy.</figcaption>
</figure> 


*Essence of Semantic Elements
According to the W3C: "A semantic Web allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities."

HTML Style Guide and Coding Conventions

*always declare doctype
<!DOCTYPE html>

*Use lower case elements
 <body>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body> 

*Close all HTML elements

 <section>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</section> 


*Use lowercase attribute Name

 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit our HTML tutorial</a> 

*Always Quote Attribute Values
 <table class="striped"> 

*Always specify alt attribute for images
 <img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5" style="width:128px;height:128px"> 

*Try not to include spaces around equal sign.
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> 

*Avoid too long code lines. So scrolling right and left can be avoided.

*Avoid blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason. Make code readable by adding blank lines to separate large of logical code blocks. Add two spaces of indentation for readability. 

* This is good
 
<body>

<h1>Famous Cities</h1>

<h2>Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan, the center of the Greater Tokyo Area,
and the most populous metropolitan area in the world.
It is the seat of the Japanese government and the Imperial Palace,
and the home of the Japanese Imperial Family.</p>

</body> 

**And example of a good table:
 <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>Description of A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>Description of B</td>
  </tr>
</table> 



*An example of a good list:

 <ul>
  <li>London</li>
  <li>Paris</li>
  <li>Tokyo</li>
</ul> 




*Never Skip the <title> Element

The content of a page title is important for SEO and is used to decide order when listing page results by search engines.


<title> elements: define a title in the browser toolbar, provide title for  the page when it is added to favorites, display title for the page in search-engine result.

*Make sure title is accurate is as meaningful as possible


<title>HTML Style Guide and Coding Conventions</title>


*Always add <html> and <body> tags

Always add the html and body tags although the html will validate without them


*Omitting <head>

The <head> tag can also be omitted. Browsers add all elements before <body> to a default <head> element. However, it is recommended that you use it. 


*Close Empty HTML Elements

You have the option to close empty elements or leave it open.. in HTML.

 <meta charset="utf-8"> 


However, for XML/XHTML, you have to close it

 <meta charset="utf-8" /> 


* Add the lang attribute

Always add the lang attribute inside your <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This helps search engines and browsers.

for example:

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html> 


*Meta Data

Always specify both language and character encoding  <meta charset="charset"> should be defined as early as possible in an HTML document:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>


*Setting the Viewport

Viewport is the user's visible area of a webpage and varies with screen size of the user's device. 

*include the following <meta> element in all y our web pages to instruct the browser on how to control the page's dimension. 

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

The 'width=device-width' sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width or the device which will very depending on the device.


The initial-scale=1.0 sets initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by browser. 

*Short comments should be written on one line:

<!-- This is a comment -->

and for comments that occupy more than one line:


<!--
  This is a long comment example. This is a long comment example.
  This is a long comment example. This is a long comment example.
-->


*Using Style Sheets

Use simple syntax for linking to style sheets( not necessary to include the type attribute)


<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

Short CSS rules can be written  compressed like this:

p.intro {font-family:Verdana;font-size:16em;}


Long CSS rules can be written over multiple lines:

body {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  font-family: "Arial Black", Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 16em;
  color: black;
}


* Some advice on how to properly include the CSS style sheet
    Place the opening bracket on the same line as the selector
    Use one space before the opening bracket
    Use two spaces of indentation
    Use semicolon after each property-value pair, including the last
    Only use quotes around values if the value contains spaces
    Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces


*Loading JS in HTML

<script src="myscript.js">


*Accessing HTML Elements with Js

The use of untidy  html code will result into Js errors. 

The below produce different results

getElementById("Demo").innerHTML = "Hello";

getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello";

 

*Use Lower Case File Names

Consistently use lower case file names because some servers(like Apache, Unix) are  case sensitive about file names while others (microsoft, IIS) are not. Annd when you make a switch while having a mix, your web will be brocken. Use lower case file names to avoid this problem. So that london.jpg and London.jpg issues do not arise. 


*File Extensions

HTML files should have a .html extension (.htm is allowed).

CSS files should have a .css extension.

JavaScript files should have a .js extension.


*Differences between .htm and .html

There is no difference between them. Consistency is good, however. 


*Default filenames:

When url does not specify filenames (such as "https:www.abc.com/"), the server adds a default filename like "index.html" and "index.htm", "default.html","default.htm".

You can always configure servers with more than one default filename, and you can usually set up as many default filename as you want. However, if your server is only configured with "index.html" as the default filename, your file must be "index.html", not default .html.
 
 
 -------

*HTML Entities
Replace reserved characters in HTML with character entities.

HTML entities
Greater than and less than are reserved html signs and browser might mix them up. 


Character entity looks like this:
&entity_name;

OR
&#entity_number;




* to display less than < sign, write &lt; or &#60;

NB: Use entity number preferably since it has more browser support.

Advantage of using an entity name: An entity name is easy to remember.
Disadvantage of using an entity name: Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for entity numbers is good.


*Non-breaking Space
&nbsp  is a space that will not break into a new line. Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together, not break into a new line. Use this when breaking words may not be disruptive.

*examples

    § 10
    10 km/h
    10 PM

*Tip: The non-breaking hyphen (&#8209;) is used to define a hyphen character (‑) that does not break into a new line.



*Some useful HTML Character Entities

Result 	Description 	Entity Name 	Entity Number
	non-breaking space 	&nbsp; 	&#160;
< 	less than 	&lt; 	&#60;
> 	greater than 	&gt; 	&#62;
& 	ampersand 	&amp; 	&#38;
" 	double quotation mark 	&quot; 	&#34;
' 	single quotation mark (apostrophe) 	&apos; 	&#39;
¢ 	cent 	&cent; 	&#162;
£ 	pound 	&pound; 	&#163;
¥ 	yen 	&yen; 	&#165;
€ 	euro 	&euro; 	&#8364;
© 	copyright 	&copy; 	&#169;
® 	registered trademark 	&reg; 	&#174;


*Combining Diacritical Marks (Useful when writing in yoruba for example and you need the ami signs on the alphabets)

A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.

Some diacritical marks, like grave (  ̀) and acute (  ́) are called accents.

Diacritical marks can appear both above and below a letter, inside a letter, and between two letters.

Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page.


*Mark 	Character 	Construct 	Result
 ̀ 	a 	a&#768; 	à
 ́ 	a 	a&#769; 	á
̂ 	a 	a&#770; 	â
 ̃ 	a 	a&#771; 	ã
 ̀ 	O 	O&#768; 	Ò
 ́ 	O 	O&#769; 	Ó
̂ 	O 	O&#770; 	Ô
 ̃ 	O 	O&#771; 	Õ

-------
*HTML Symbols

You can add symbols absent on your keyboard to html using entities.

Many mathematical symbols are present in HTML. You also have greek letters and many more entities. 

NB: THIS SECTION HAS ABOUT 3 TABLES. Create HTML table in github later.

----
HTML EMOJIS
*Using Emojis in HTML

Emojis are characters from UTF-8 character set:

They look like images, or icons, but they are not. and they are letters( characters) from UTF-8 (Unicode) character set. 

UTF-8 covers almost all existing characters and symbols

-----
HTML CHARSET
HTML charset attribute:
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page. 


<meta charset="UTF-8">

if you do not specify the charset, "UTF-8" is the default in HTML.


UTF-8 Characters: You can't type them on the keyboard but they can always be displayed using numbers ( entity numbers)

*Both <p> in the paragraph below are the same

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>

<p>I will display A B C</p>
<p>I will display &#65; &#66; &#67;</p>

</body>
</html> 

*A, B, C are 65, 66, and 67 respectively


To let browser recognize that you are displaying a utf-8 character, you must start with &# and end it with a semi-colon (;)


Emojis are also characters from utf-8.


* You can size emojis like other characters

<p style="font-size:48px">
&#128512; &#128516; &#128525; &#128151;
</p>

*HTML Encoding ( Character sets)

A browser must know the character set to use to display it correctly. 

**Excerpts from the HTML ENCODING CHAPTER
From ASCII to UTF-8

ASCII was the first character encoding standard. ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .

ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set supported 256 different character codes. HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.

ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1, except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.

The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!


**HTML charset attribute
you specify it in the <meta> tag of the HTML page.


<meta charset="UTF-8">

------------------
HTML URL

HTML Uniform Resource Locators.

WEbbrowsers use URL to request pages from web servers. URL is used to address documents ( or other data) on the web. 

scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename 

Explanation:

    scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
    prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)
    domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)
    port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)
    path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)
    filename - defines the name of a document or resource


*Common URL Schemes

Common URL Schemes

The table below lists some common schemes:
Scheme 	Short for 	Used for
http 	HyperText Transfer Protocol 	Common web pages. Not encrypted
https 	Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol 	Secure web pages. Encrypted
ftp 	File Transfer Protocol 	Downloading or uploading files
file 	  	A file on your computer


*URLs can only be sent over the internet using the ASCII character set. The URL has to be converted if it contains outside characters. 
non-ASCII characters are replaced by  % followed by hexadecimal units. and Spaces are normally replaced by + (plus) sign.

*Your browser will encode character-set used in your page, default character-set in HTML5 is UTF-8.


-----
*HTML VS XHTML

XHTML is more strict and more XML-based version of HTML. 

What is XHTML?

    XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
    XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML
    XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
    XHTML is supported by all major browsers

*Differences between HTML and XHTML
in XHTML

    <!DOCTYPE> is mandatory
    The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
    <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory
    Elements must always be properly nested
    Elements must always be closed
    Elements must always be in lowercase
    Attribute names must always be in lowercase
    Attribute values must always be quoted
    Attribute minimization is forbidden


*XHTML - <!DOCTYPE ....> Is Mandatory

The <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> elements must also be present. The xmlns attribute in <htmk> must specify the xml namespace for the document. 

 <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
  <title>Title of document</title>

*XHTML Elements Must be Properly Nested
 <b><i>Some text</i></b>  
don't switch the tags.



*XHTML Elements Must Always be Closed.

 <p>This is a paragraph</p>
<p>This is another paragraph</p> 



*XHTML Empty Elements Must Always be Closed.
A break: <br />
A horizontal rule: <hr />
An image: <img src="happy.gif" alt="Happy face" />


XHTML Elements Must be in Lowercase.

** Part 2: HTML Forms
------
HTML Forms

*Filling a form that contains user name and password and that redirects the form to a specific page after servers process the input.

<h2>HTML Forms</h2>

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 

<p>If you click the "Submit" button, the form-data will be sent to a page called "/action_page.php".</p>


* The <form> Element

The HTML <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input:

<form>

form elements

</form>


The form element is like a container for all kinds of  input elements like: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.


*The <input> element: is the most used form element and can be displayed on the 'type' attribute. 

Type 	Description
<input type="text"> 	Displays a single-line text input field
<input type="radio"> 	Displays a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
<input type="checkbox"> 	Displays a checkbox (for selecting zero or more of many choices)
<input type="submit"> 	Displays a submit button (for submitting the form)
<input type="button"> 	Displays a clickable button


*Text Fields: <input type="text"> 

This defines a single-line input field for text input. The form itself is not visible and the number of characters is by default 20 characters. 

 <form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">
</form> 

The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements.

The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.

The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.

The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together. 


*Radio Buttons

<input type="radio"> defines the radio button which lets use select ONLY one among a few choices.

*see sample radio buttons below:
 <form>
  <input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male">
  <label for="male">Male</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="female" name="gender" value="female">
  <label for="female">Female</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="other" name="gender" value="other">
  <label for="other">Other</label>
</form> 



*Checkboxes: Enables users select zero or more among a limited no of choices 

<input type="checkbox"> defines a checkbox

NB: the value attribute  can indicate the default option
 
*See example of form below:
<form>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">
  <label for="vehicle1"> I have a bike</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle2" name="vehicle2" value="Car">
  <label for="vehicle2"> I have a car</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat">
  <label for="vehicle3"> I have a boat</label>
</form> 


*The Submit Button

<input type="submit"> defines the button for submitting form data to a form-handler. 

Example of a form with a submit button below: 

 <form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 


*The Name Attribute for <input>
*Each input field must have a name to be submitted. If the value of the name attribute is omitted, the input field value will not be sent at all. 


-------
*The HTML Form Attribute: A discussion of different attributes

The Action Attribute: defines action to be performed when form is submitted.  Form data is usually sent to a file on  server when submit button is clicked. If you omit action attribute, the action is set to the current page.

*To send form data to a file called action_page.php containing a server-side script that handles the form data:

 <form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 


*The Target Attribute
This specified where to display response received after submitting the form. 

See below for the possible values of the target attribute

Value 	Description
_blank 	The response is displayed in a new window or tab
_self 	The response is displayed in the current window (default)
_parent 	The response is displayed in the parent frame
_top 	The response is displayed in the full body of the window
framename 	The response is displayed in a named iframe


*Example of the use of target attribute:
<p>When submitting this form, the result will be opened in a new browser tab:</p>

<form action="/action_page.php" target="_blank">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 


*The Method Attribute

This specifies the method attribute specifies HTTP method used when submitting form data. 


*The get method: <form action="/action_page.php" method="get"> 
*The post method:  <form action="/action_page.php" method="post"> 

*Tip: Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information!

Notes on GET:

    Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
    NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
    The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
    Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
    GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

Notes on POST:

    Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
    POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
    Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

Tip: Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information!



*The Autocomplete Attribute
Specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off. Autocomplete when left on enables browser automatically complete values based on previously entered values in the same browser. 

 <form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on"> 


The Novalidate Attribute
This is a boolean attribute which specifies form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted. 

<form action="/action_page.php" novalidate> 

*List of All <form> Attributes
Attribute 	Description
accept-charset 	Specifies the character encodings used for form submission
action 	Specifies where to send the form-data when a form is submitted
autocomplete 	Specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off
enctype 	Specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitting it to the server (only for method="post")
method 	Specifies the HTTP method to use when sending form-data
name 	Specifies the name of the form
novalidate 	Specifies that the form should not be validated when submitted
rel 	Specifies the relationship between a linked resource and the current document
target 	Specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form

----------------
HTML <form> Elements

The HTML <form> element can contain one or more of the following form elements:

    <input>
    <label>
    <select>
    <textarea>
    <button>
    <fieldset>
    <legend>
    <datalist>
    <output>
    <option>
    <optgroup>


*The <input> Element
Input element is one of the most used form element. Can be displayed in varying ways depending on the type attribute

<label for="fname">First name:</label>
<input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"> 

*The <label> Element

<label> element defines a label for several form elements. Helps screen-readers  read out the label when the user focus on the input. 
It also helps users click on text next to small regions ( like checkboxes and buttons)  to click those small areas. 

The 'for' attribute of the <label> tag should equal to the 'id' attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.


*The <select> Element
This element defvines a drop-down list:

 <label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>
<select id="cars" name="cars">
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="fiat">Fiat</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select> 

* The option elements defines an option that can be selected. The first item is selected by default. Add the 'selected' attribute to an option to make it pre-selected. 

 <option value="fiat" selected>Fiat</option> 

*Visible Values: Use size attribute to specify the number of visible values (a small scroll bar is inserted if you have more than the visible value set)

 <label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>
<select id="cars" name="cars" size="3">
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="fiat">Fiat</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select> 


*Allow Multiple Selections: 'multiple' attribute allow user to select more than one value. To use this, you have to Hold down the Ctrl (windows) / Command (Mac) button to select multiple options

 <label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>
<select id="cars" name="cars" size="4" multiple>
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="fiat">Fiat</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select> 



*The <textarea> Element
The <textarea> element defines a multi-line input field (a text area):
The rows attribute specifies the visible number of lines in a text area.

The cols attribute specifies the visible width of a text area.

This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

<textarea name="message" rows="10" cols="30">
The cat was playing in the garden.
</textarea> 

CSS can also be used to define the size of the text area. 


<textarea name="message" style="width:200px; height:600px;">
The cat was playing in the garden.
</textarea> 


*The <button> Element
Defines a clickable button. 

 <button type="button" onclick="alert('Hello World!')">Click Me!</button> 


Note: Always specify the type attribute for the button element. Different browsers may use different default types for the button element.


*The <fieldset> and <legend> Elements

The <fieldset> element is used to group related data in a form.

The <legend> element defines a caption for the <fieldset> element.


 <form action="/action_page.php">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Personalia:</legend>
    <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
    <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </fieldset>
</form> 



* The <datalist> Element
Specifies a list of pre-defined options for an <input> element (works like a kind of autocomplete which list options you can select from once you type a text) This should be usable with the normal form input element--experiment.

Users will see a drop-down list of the pre-defined options as they input data.

The list attribute of the <input> element, must refer to the id attribute of the <datalist> element

The datalist tag is not supported in Safari prior version 12.1

 <form action="/action_page.php">
  <input list="browsers">
  <datalist id="browsers">
    <option value="Internet Explorer">
    <option value="Firefox">
    <option value="Chrome">
    <option value="Opera">
    <option value="Safari">
  </datalist>
</form> 


*The <output> Element
Rep the result of a calculation ( such as one performed by a script)

 <form action="/action_page.php"
  oninput="x.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
  0
  <input type="range"  id="a" name="a" value="50">
  100 +
  <input type="number" id="b" name="b" value="50">
  =
  <output name="x" for="a b"></output>
  <br><br>
  <input type="submit">
</form>

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="points">Points:</label>
  <input type="number" id="points" name="points" step="3">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">

The input height and width attributes specify the height and width of an <input type="image"> element.

Tip: Always specify both the height and width attributes for images. If height and width are set, the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded. Without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it. The effect will be that the page layout will change during loading (while the images load).

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
  <input type="image" src="img_submit.gif" alt="Submit" width="48" height="48">

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <input list="browsers" name="browser">
  <datalist id="browsers">
    <option value="Internet Explorer">
    <option value="Firefox">
    <option value="Chrome">
    <option value="Opera">
    <option value="Safari">
  </datalist>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>



*The Autocomplete Attribute

The input autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form or an input field should have autocomplete on or off.

Autocomplete allows the browser to predict the value. When a user starts to type in a field, the browser should display options to fill in the field, based on earlier typed values.

The autocomplete attribute works with <form> and the following <input> types: text, search, url, tel, email, password, datepickers, range, and color.

In the case below, the autocomplete is on for the form but off for the email field. Fill in the form and reload to see the effect. 

<form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" autocomplete="off"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>


*Use maxlength for no of characters: maxlength="40"  
And use max for numeric value, use max: max=40

The form-data can be sent as URL variables (method="get") or as an HTTP post transaction (method="post").

Notes on the "get" method:

    This method appends the form-data to the URL in name/value pairs
    This method is useful for form submissions where a user want to bookmark the result
    There is a limit to how much data you can place in a URL (varies between browsers), therefore, you cannot be sure that all of the form-data will be correctly transferred
    Never use the "get" method to pass sensitive information! (password or other sensitive information will be visible in the browser's address bar)

Notes on the "post" method:

    This method sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction
    Form submissions with the "post" method cannot be bookmarked
    The "post" method is more robust and secure than "get", and "post" does not have size limitations


<form action="/action_page.php" method="get" target="_blank">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit using GET">
  <input type="submit" formmethod="post" value="Submit using POST">
</form>


*The formtarget Attribute

The input formtarget attribute specifies a name or a keyword that indicates where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.

Note: This attribute overrides the target attribute of the <form> element.

The formtarget attribute works with the following input types: submit and image.<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  <input type="submit" formtarget="_blank" value="Submit to a new window/tab">
</form>


*The formnovalidate Attribute
The input formnovalidate attribute specifies that an <input> element should not be validated when submitted.

Note: This attribute overrides the novalidate attribute of the <form> element.

The formnovalidate attribute works with the following input types: submit.


<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="email">Enter your email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  <input type="submit" formnovalidate="formnovalidate" value="Submit without validation">
</form>


*The novalidate attribute
The novalidate attribute is a <form> attribute.

When present, novalidate specifies that all of the form-data should not be validated when submitted.

<form action="/action_page.php" novalidate>
  <label for="email">Enter your email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

PART 4: HTML GRAPHICS

HTML cANVAS GRAPHICS

It is used to draw graphics on a webpage. You use <canvas> element to create the canvas.

The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.


A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content.


Example of the canvas markup: 

 <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>


Note: Always specify an id attribute (to be referred to in a script), and a width and height attribute to define the size of the canvas. To add a border, use the style attribute.



Example:
 <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
</canvas> 


NB: Canvas can draw line, circle, draw text, Stroke text, Draw linar gradient, draw circular gradient, draw image into an empty canvas line. Since Javascript is used to create the canvas, detailed study of  canvas will be made under javascript training. 
-----------------------------------

HTML SVG 


SVG can draw circle, rectangle, rounded rectangle, svg star, svg logo. 

Differences Between SVG and Canvas

SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.

Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with a JavaScript).

SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.

In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.

Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser. If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.


Comparison of Canvas and SVG

The table below shows some important differences between Canvas and SVG:
Canvas 	SVG

    Resolution dependent
    No support for event handlers
    Poor text rendering capabilities
    You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
    Well suited for graphic-intensive games

	

    Resolution independent
    Support for event handlers
    Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps)
    Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow)
    Not suited for game applications


------------------------------------------
PART 5: HTML MEDIA

HTML Multimedia:

Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations.

Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML VIDEO

The <video> element is used to shows a video on a page. 


<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


"controls" attribute adds video controls like play, pause, and volume. It is good to include width and height attributes. Without setting these, the page may move irregularly or unsteadily as the video loads. 

The <source> element allows specifying alternative video files that the browser may choose from. The browser by default chooses the first recognized format. The text between video tags will only be displayed if browser does not support the <video> element. 

*HTML <video> Autoplay

*Autoplay attribute starts video automatically. 

<video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

The autoplay attribute does not work in mobile devices like iPad and iPhone.


*HTML Video Formats

There are three supported video formats: MP4, WebM, and Ogg. The browser support for the different formats is:
Browser 	MP4 	WebM 	Ogg
Edge 	YES 	YES 	YES
Chrome 	YES 	YES 	YES
Firefox 	YES 	YES 	YES
Safari 	YES 	YES 	NO
Opera 	YES 	YES 	YES


*HTML Video - Media Types
File Format 	Media Type
MP4 	video/mp4
WebM 	video/webm
Ogg 	video/ogg



*HTML Video - Methods, Properties, and Events

The HTML DOM defines methods, properties, and events for the <video> element.

This allows you to load, play, and pause videos, as well as setting duration and volume.

There are also DOM events that can notify you when a video begins to play, is paused, etc.


*See HTML video audio DOM reference for details of how to customize video in HTML


Summary

  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 


*HTML Audio - How It Works

The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.


There are three supported audio format: MP3, WAV, OGG. 


Opera, Firefox and Chrome support all audio formats. Edge/Internet explorer supports only MP3 while Safari supports only MP3 and WAV.


HTML Audio - Media Types

------------------------------------------

HTML Plug-ins

They extend the standard functionality of the browser. Plug-ins can serve the following purposes: 
    To run Java applets
    To run Microsoft ActiveX controls
    To display Flash movies
    To display maps
    To scan for viruses
    To verify a bank id

Warning !

Most browsers no longer support Java Applets and Plug-ins.

ActiveX controls are no longer supported in any browsers.

The support for Shockwave Flash has also been turned off in modern browsers.


The <object> Element

<object> is supported by all browsers and it defines embeded object within an HTML document. It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML:

<object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>
 

*You can also embed an image as an object

<object data="audi.jpeg"></object>


*The <embed> Element
It is supported in all major browsers and defines an embedded object within an HTML document. It is part of HTML5 spec even though it does not show up in the previous versions that it supported. 

<embed src="audi.jpeg">



Note that the <embed> element does not have a closing tag. It can not contain alternative text.

*The <embed> element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:


<embed width="100%" height="500px" src="snippet.html">


One thing you should note is that to select which to use between <object> and <embed>, make sure you consider which is most widely supported by various browsers and your data type embeded.

------------------------------------------

HTML YouTube Videos

This is the easiest way to play videos in HTML because it removes the necessity of converting to different formats. YouTube can be allowed to play videos on your website to avoid the conversion problem. 


*YouTube Video Id

YouTube will display an id (like tgbNymZ7vqY), when you save (or play) a video.

You can use this id, and refer to your video in the HTML code.



*Playing YouTube in HTML

To play your video on a web page, do the following:

    Upload the video to YouTube
    Take a note of the video id
    Define an <iframe> element in your web page
    Let the src attribute point to the video URL
    Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player
    Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)


<iframe width="420" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY">
</iframe>


*YouTube Autoplay + Mute

You can let your video start playing automatically when a user visits the page, by adding autoplay=1 to the YouTube URL.

Note: Automatically starting a video can annoy your visitor and end up causing more harm than good!

Chrome added stricter autoplay policies in 2018. Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in all cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

Add mute=1 after autoplay=1 to let your video start playing automatically (but muted).


<iframe width="420" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?autoplay=1&mute=1">
</iframe>


 <iframe width="420" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?playlist=tgbNymZ7vqY&loop=1">
</iframe>



<iframe width="420" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?playlist=tgbNymZ7vqY&loop=1">
</iframe>


*YouTube Controls

Add controls=0 to display controls in the video player.

Value 0: Player controls does not display.

Value 1 (default): Player controls display.


<iframe width="420" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY?controls=0">
</iframe>

------------------------------------------

Part 6 HTML API

HTML GEOLOCATION API
*HTML Geolocation API is used to locate a user position. 

*Locate the user's Position

The HTML Geolocation API is used to get the geographical position of a user.

Since this can compromise privacy, the position is not available unless the user approves it.

Note: Geolocation is most accurate for devices with GPS, like smartphones.


Note: As of Chrome 50, the Geolocation API will only work on secure contexts such as HTTPS. If your site is hosted on an non-secure origin (such as HTTP) the requests to get the users location will no longer function.


The getCurrentPosition() method is used to return the user's position.

The example below returns the latitude and longitude of the user's position( a basic geolocation without error handling):

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = document.getElementById("demo");

function getLocation() {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition);
  } else { 
    x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
  }
}

function showPosition(position) {
  x.innerHTML = "Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude + 
  "<br>Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;
}
</script>



code above explained.

Example explained:

    Check if Geolocation is supported
    If supported, run the getCurrentPosition() method. If not, display a message to the user
    If the getCurrentPosition() method is successful, it returns a coordinates object to the function specified in the parameter (showPosition)
    The showPosition() function outputs the Latitude and Longitude

The example above is a very basic Geolocation script, with no error handling.


*Handling Errors and Rejections

The second parameter of the getCurrentPosition() method is used to handle errors. It specifies a function to run if it fails to get the user's location:

<button onclick="getLocation()">Try It</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = document.getElementById("demo");

function getLocation() {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition, showError);
  } else { 
    x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
  }
}

function showPosition(position) {
  x.innerHTML = "Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude + 
  "<br>Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;
}

function showError(error) {
  switch(error.code) {
    case error.PERMISSION_DENIED:
      x.innerHTML = "User denied the request for Geolocation."
      break;
    case error.POSITION_UNAVAILABLE:
      x.innerHTML = "Location information is unavailable."
      break;
    case error.TIMEOUT:
      x.innerHTML = "The request to get user location timed out."
      break;
    case error.UNKNOWN_ERROR:
      x.innerHTML = "An unknown error occurred."
      break;
  }
}
</script>



*Displaying the Result in a Map

To display the result in a map, you need access to a map service, like Google Maps.

In the example below, the returned latitude and longitude is used to show the location in a Google Map (using a static image):


function showPosition(position) {
  var latlon = position.coords.latitude + "," + position.coords.longitude;

  var img_url = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=
  "+latlon+"&zoom=14&size=400x300&sensor=false&key=YOUR_KEY";

  document.getElementById("mapholder").innerHTML = "<img src='"+img_url+"'>";
}


*Location-specific Information

This page has demonstrated how to show a user's position on a map.

Geolocation is also very useful for location-specific information, like:

    Up-to-date local information
    Showing Points-of-interest near the user
    Turn-by-turn navigation (GPS)



The getCurrentPosition() Method - Return Data

The getCurrentPosition() method returns an object on success. The latitude, longitude and accuracy properties are always returned. The other properties are returned if available:
Property 	Returns
coords.latitude 	The latitude as a decimal number (always returned)
coords.longitude 	The longitude as a decimal number (always returned)
coords.accuracy 	The accuracy of position (always returned)
coords.altitude 	The altitude in meters above the mean sea level (returned if available)
coords.altitudeAccuracy 	The altitude accuracy of position (returned if available)
coords.heading 	The heading as degrees clockwise from North (returned if available)
coords.speed 	The speed in meters per second (returned if available)
timestamp 	The date/time of the response (returned if available)



Geolocation Object - Other interesting Methods

The Geolocation object also has other interesting methods:

    watchPosition() - Returns the current position of the user and continues to return updated position as the user moves (like the GPS in a car).
    clearWatch() - Stops the watchPosition() method.

The example below shows the watchPosition() method. You need an accurate GPS device to test this (like smartphone): 



<p>Click the button to get your coordinates.</p>

<button onclick="getLocation()">Try It</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = document.getElementById("demo");

function getLocation() {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(showPosition);
  } else { 
    x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
  }
}
    
function showPosition(position) {
    x.innerHTML="Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude + 
    "<br>Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;
}
</script>



---------------------------------------

HTML Drag and Drop API: Can be used to make an element draggable.

HTML Web Storage API: Enables users to store data locally within user's browser. The storage limit is greater than that of cookies.the storage is per origin ( per domain and protocol). Pages from one origin can store and access the same data.


HTML Web Workers API: It is a JS running in background without affecting the performance of the page. This prevents the page from becoming unresponsive until the script in the background finishes loading. 

Since web workers are in external files, they do not have access to the following JavaScript objects:

    The window object
    The document object
    The parent object


HTML Server Sent Events (SSE) API
*Server-Sent Events - One Way Messaging

It allows a webpage to get updates from a server. An SSE is when a webpage gets updates from a server automatically. 


Examples of server sent events: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds, sport results, etc.


*Receive Server-Sent Event Notifications

The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications. 
 

You need a server that is capable of sending data updates like PHP or ASP

To include anchor links (enables you to jump from section to section within the same file) in your read.md file,
To create anchor links that jump down to different sections of a README (as in an interactive table of contents), first create a heading:
#Real Cool Heading

The anchor link for that heading is the lowercase heading name with dashes where there are spaces. You can always get the anchor name by visiting the README on Github.com and clicking on the anchor that appears when you hover to the left of the heading. Copy everything starting at the #:
#real-cool-heading

Wherever you want to link to your Real Cool Heading section, put your desired text in brackets, followed by the anchor link in parentheses:
[Go to Real Cool Heading section](#real-cool-heading)


1. Creating a heading (in the content section):  #HTML Introduction
2. To link to the HTML Introduction section (in the outline), put the text you want to see in the outline in the square bracket(i.e [HTML Intromimo])
and include the anchor in a normal bracket following the displayed text in outline (i.e. (#html-introduction)). Note that the anchor link for the HTML introduction
in the outline is the lower case version of the outline component in the content with hyphen replacing spaces(i.e #html-intromimo)
